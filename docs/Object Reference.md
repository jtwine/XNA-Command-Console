## Compiled HTML Docs
The generated API document, presented as a CHM file, is available here: [ApiRefXNACC.chm](Object Reference_ApiRefXNACC.chm).
**Note:** This file may not display correctly if you open it directly from this site.  Better to save it to a known location and then try to launch it.  If all the HTML Help viewer shows are browser-related errors (e.g. navigation canceled, etc.), close the file, raise its Properties in Explorer and _unblock_ it. 

## Web Site Docs
There is also a navigable web site for the docs, available in this archive:  [ApiRefXNACC.zip](Object Reference_ApiRefXNACC.zip).  
Note that the HTML pages appear to require I.E. to work correctly. Chrome, as an example, does not work well with the pages.  I have not tested with other browsers.
